# A profile page to introduce my self. 

I started coding in 2018 while taking a Web Developement Bootcamp here in Gainesville, Florida called Gainesville Dev Academy.
It quickly became a passion of mine and finally brought some clarity to what I wanted to achieve in my life. I created this page to introduce myself to people and to freshen up my skills. It is not much but its always enjoyable to create things for myself and to give people a small glimpse of what I am capable of.
